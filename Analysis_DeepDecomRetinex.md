# Deep Decomposition Retinex Based Low-light Image Enhancement
## Retinex-Net
* The classic Retinex theory models the human color perception. It assumes that the observed images can be decomposed into two components, reflectance and illumination. Let S represent the source image, then it can be denoted by this formula, where R represents reflectance, I represents illumination and â—¦ represents element-wise multiplication.
